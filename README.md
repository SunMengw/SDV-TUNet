Sparse Dynamic Volume TransUNet with multi-level edge fusion for brain tumor segmentation
=


Highlights
-
•Propose a novel encoder-decoder-based 3D brain tumor segmentation network.  

•Combine voxel information, inter-layer feature connection and intra-axis information.  

•Dynamically extract 3D spatial features and capture fine-grained edge details.  

•Introduce a local-to-global feature modeling strategy for accurate segmentation.  

Datasets
