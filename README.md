Sparse Dynamic Volume TransUNet with multi-level edge fusion for brain tumor segmentation

3D MRI Brain Tumor Segmentation is of great significance in clinical diagnosis and treatment. Accurate segmentation results are critical for localization and spatial distribution of brain tumors using 3D MRI. However, most existing methods mainly focus on extracting global semantic features from the spatial and depth dimensions of a 3D volume, while ignoring voxel information, inter-layer connections, and detailed
features.
